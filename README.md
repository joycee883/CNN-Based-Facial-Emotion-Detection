# 🎯 CNN-Based Facial Emotion Detection 😄😞 <br>
Facial Emotion Detection is a powerful, real-time emotion classifier that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify emotions like "Happy" or "Not Happy" from facial images. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, this project leverages the power of deep learning to detect human emotions in a visually engaging and accurate manner.

## 🚀 Project Overview 🧠 <br>
This innovative project transforms facial images into emotion classifiers by applying deep learning techniques. With a CNN-based architecture, the system analyzes faces, detects emotions, and provides an instant response. Whether it's for social media analysis, human-computer interaction, or mental health insights, this tool is designed to be fast, accurate, and intuitive.
